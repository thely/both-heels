## both heels

_for June Cummings, and Reese_

### INT. Concert Hall - Lights up

WE OPEN to a percussion setup on the stage of a concert hall, with a stately armchair and side table on stage left, and a kick drum on stage right. A board downstage wide enough to walk on spans from SL to SR (see diagram).

Seated comfortably in the chair is June, a young Asian American woman, wearing a wrap dress and periously-tall high heels. She stares idly at her phone, looking around occasionally, waiting for someone. Her legs are crossed, and her dangling foot taps at the air.

The DATE begins speaking. June faces the audience as if making eye contact with someone specific, appearing cautiously happy to see the DATE.

{% include dialog.html speaker="Date" line="Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late, I got caught in the––" %}

In response, June begins playing the wine glass, dreamily. She hums along with the ringing sound it makes, going from single tones to simple melodies. Initially, the tones are in response to what the DATE is saying, but the DATE's voice keeps getting more and more mumbly, and June's playing of the glass becomes less tied to the conversation.

Since the table with the glass is to one side of her instead of directly in front, she has to keep repositioning herself in the chair to get comfortable. We hear the sound of her heels tapping and sliding, punctuating between the long, clear tones of the wine glass, which is likely interrupted by all the movement. She keeps stretching out her right leg to try and stabilize, (deliberately?) not noticing the kick drum off to her right.

{% include dialog.html speaker="Date" line="Have you ordered already?" %}

### Attempt 1: Survey

A noise begins in the background that seems to catch her attention; she looks at the kick drum, which seems to be the source of the sound. Something about it vexes her, and she turns back to face the audience, attempting to resume the easygoing mood she had moments before.

But the drum...

While her right leg was previously stretched out for stability, now she seems determined to reach it. She glances at the drum only when she thinks she can get away with it, because nothing is _wrong_, clearly she _can_ reach it... the noise in the background just seems to keep getting louder, which just makes her want to try even harder.

While her previous contortion in the seat was meant to make playing the glass easier, now she keeps scooting farther and farther forward in the seat, sliding towards the kick slightly more each time she adds a touch more distance. Playing the glass is, at this point, nearly impossible, but to stop doing so would be admitting defeat.

She manages to reach the kick pedal. She's able to get her right foot on the pedal, but the pedal itself is too far from the drum. If we hear anything at all, it's only the sound of the hinge. She _might_ be able to get the beater to make contact with the drum once or twice, but very quietly.

A melodic alarm or jingle plays. It jars her out of her thoughts and away from the kick (which must have been just a memory), and she scoots suddenly back into her chair. A beat later, she gets up, walking to face the board that lines the front of the stage. She seems positive, at least - not cheery, but confident. After the jingle plays a certain four-count, she walks across the board to its tempo.

When she's perpendicular to the kick drum, though, her footsteps are suddenly, disturbingly loud. She winces as she realizes it's the kick she's hearing. The surprise makes her lose the rhythm of the jingle, but she still makes it to the end of the board. She turns around and waits for the jingle to resume, which takes longer to start than she's comfortable with. Again, the kick rings out as she passes it; again, she feels her teeth clench and tries (fails?) not to stumble.

### Attempt 2: Avoidance

She sits again, and looks out to the audience, her face a little more muted this time than when the piece began.

{% include dialog.html speaker="Date" line="So what's your favorite kind of––" %}

She returns to playing the glass as a response, but after very little dreamy ringing she feels her right foot start sliding (unacceptable). Simple tones are no longer enough, but clearly the kick isn't the problem here, because the kick was a memory and doesn't exist. She just needs a distraction.

There's a whole place setting on the table she'd ignored until now. Fork in hand, she at first focuses on rhythmic gestures against the glass and plate as responses to the now-incomprehensible speech of the date, but then the noise starts again...

Everything slides as she seems to remember - her leg, her gaze, the silverware, the plate. Not with shock, not with horror, at least not yet. Just as she starts realizing she could stretch towards the kick, the DATE asks another question, and she snaps back to the table.

{% include dialog.html speaker="Date" line="Do you think you might ever visit a place like––" %}

When trying not to think about something that _clearly_ isn't there (she repeats and extends her full-body slide towards the kick, but won't admit it), she finds herself rearranging what's on the table - at first a bit chaotically, but later methodically. She has moments of clarity whenever the DATE asks a question not drowned out by the background noise, but as the noise gets louder, the rearrangement becomes deeply intentional, almost meditative. She finds one rearrangement pattern to repeat on a loop, slowing down the tempo as time seems to move much faster than it ought to, as her right leg seems to drift without her even realizing such a thing could -

The jingle again. She stands up, looking at her hands as if they were strangers as she walks towards the board. This time, the recording of her previous walk (with distant, reverberant kick drum behind it) starts to play slightly before the four-count that leads her into the walk across. She hesitates to even start walking because of it, but she does it anyway, half-hiding her eyes. When she reaches the middle, the kick sound is somewhat present, but there are also small bits of clear speech. She seems to relax a little. The steps & kick play again during her pause before crossing back, but she makes it through mostly intact.

With her back to the board, the jingle complete she hears one huge SLAM from a kick. Never safe. Never safe.

### Attempt 3: Aggravation

She sits again, poised as if to start playing the glass a third time. She seems nervous.

{% include dialog.html speaker="Date" line="If you were on a deserted island, what would be your––" %}

She pauses, as if considering the question, but then suddenly decides against answering normally. She grabs one stick (chopstick? drumstick?) and starts playing everything in her immediate area as if attempting to find the one clue that lets her leave. While staying in the chair, she goes after the table first. She picks up each object on the table individually with one hand, turns it around while playing it with the stick in the other hand, places it back down, reshuffles the objects, considers their order.

The noise starts again; whatever curiousity she may have expressed on the first inspection is rushed through on the section. Each object is raised again, played again, but this time is hurriedly placed on the floor afterward. The table empty, she first plays the table, but then lifts it up, drops it noisily, picks it up again, turns it upside down, drops it, plays the legs. She reaches back down for every piece of silverware she previously dropped and tries them all as sticks against the legs of the table. Sometimes pointedly, sometimes hurreidly. Every time she stretches her right leg out to try and help keep herself stabilized, she pointedly picks it back up and **slams** it next to the other foot.

As the noise gets louder, just as it did the last two times, she finds herself in a pattern, similar to what she did with the silverware rearrangement in the previous section. At first playing a rapid-fire sequence of hits, the loudness of the noise seems to instead slow her down - taps become slides, gestures bleed into each other, her whole body seems to slowly turn towards the kick, she swore she wouldn't but -

The jingle plays. She places whatever she's holding down slowly, deliberately. She stands at her own pace, ignoring the usual promptness the jingle demands.

The piece waits for her to walk across the board. When she hits the midpoint of the board (which she approaches with mild loathing) on her first pass, the jingle actually fades out. She makes it across, both ways, with only slight flinching. But after she finishes, _then_ she hears her steps echo, _then_ she hears the kick.

She takes a long, hard look at the chair before sitting back down.

### Attempt 4: Recontextualization

{% include dialog.html speaker="Date" line="What do you think you want to do in the next––" %}

The date starts again, but the table is still upended, and all the cutlery is still on the floor. The sound of the glass plays in the background. She picks up the sticks from the floor and does nothing for awhile. Maybe she hums.

When she finally decides to play again, it's the chair she goes for. First she idly plays the arms, then follows them up and around to the back (twisting fully, one knee in the seat, the other outstretched towards you-know-what). She switches which stick or piece of cutlery she's using occasionally, but it's less like the manic investigation from the previous section, and more like greeting daylight after waking up from a horrible dream. Not happy, exactly, but at least relieved.

As the noise begins, she turns to face forward again and starts playing the legs of the chair. Sometimes she can do this while sitting normally, sometimes she has to double over. Eventually, without realizing what she's doing, she gets down on the floor to make it easier to play the chair legs, the table legs, the chair arms, maybe even the floor.

At some point, the noise gets loud enough that she remembers where she is again. Still trying to play the legs of the chair, she realizes she could probably reach the kick now. She keeps her upper body near the chair, but winds up practically lying down as she tries to reach her leg out, almost there, almost there -

The jingle. She lifts up to a sitting position with a start, hitting the pedal (and, by extension, the kick) completely by accident. She tries, but realizes she can't stand up fast enough to get over to the board, so she scrambles to do the next best thing - she plays the sticks across the board as if they were her heels. She's too focused on a good representation of the sound to actually worry about anything else that's happening. She's almost visibly keeping time to try and make sure it's accurate.

### Chunk 5: Accepting

Normally, there's a bit of a pause between the end of the jingle and the date resuming. Not so this time. She looks over at the chair, realizes she couldn't possibly get back in time, and just... lets the date go on its own for a bit. The glass is ringing in the recording again, same as last time, so clearly something's going right. Maybe she hums along for a moment.

She turns back to face the kick. It's just... it's right there? Seems almost ridiculous now. She plays it via the pedal - loudly - with her feet a few times, experimentally, then with her hand. And then she grabs anything she had - the sticks, the plate, the glass - and tries them out on the kick. She plays the sides, she plays the plate against the drum head, she rattles the sticks across the pins, she moves the pedal away and plays it separately from the drum itself. It's like riding a bike again for the first time in ages, and the breeze is lovely outside. You forgot how nice the world feels.

Eventually, we hear the jingle again. Without rushing, she lies down next to the board, so that one arm can play the board, and one foot can play the kick via the pedal. She improvises to the rhythm of the jingle once the four-count starts. Partway through, the previous recording of her walking across the plank plays as well, though she might not realize it. After the jingle ends, the walking recording keeps playing, and so does she. Eventually the walking fades out into the distance, and her playing gets softer and softer.

Silence. It takes her awhile to stand, but she does. She hits the kick pedal once on the way up. If she bows, she bows with her foot still on it.
