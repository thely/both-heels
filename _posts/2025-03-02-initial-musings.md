I've begun a skin care routine. I told myself I would never begin a skin care routine, but here I am. I have four things that I put on my face in the morning, and I'm limiting it to two at night. There is a bear headband that Heather got from Ulta that she left when she moved out to Philly, and I'm the one that wears it now. I wear the headband, I put my hair in a clip to keep it out of my face, and I think of Heather.

And I think of June. I'm pretty sure I'm doing all this because of June, at least subconsciously. First I find a YouTube channel with good advice on hair, a bit at random. The advice is good, so I try buying a few of the things the channel recommends. I'm inspecting my hair, and it makes me notice the redness on my face. I start wondering, was my face always red? When was this from? I don't think I always had these bumps. (When I talk about this with my mom, she mentions she's always had redness. She embarassed easily and blushed a lot when she was working.)

But the thing that's happening here is that I'm making changes I never thought I would, in part because my body is changing, _because_ her body is changed. Taking hormones is a huge step for a trans woman. It's edible or injectable proof of their choices. They are _choosing_ a new body, even though it's insane, even though it's wildly, medically unsafe. Even though it's socially polarizing. They are still deliberately choosing to be something I've always taken for granted.

So it doesn't matter how you do or don't feel about transitioning, politically. The important thing here is that I've never leaned in to being female. So I might as well try.

June is also a percussionist. She's buff as all hell. How strong can I be? How do I write for percussion when I barely have stamina on my own?
